## What is Color Mix

Color Mix is a small cross platform desktop utility designed to aid users in picking colors. Color Mix solves several problems I experience when picking colors while using a pc to write programs or am being creative generating designs. The first problem is that when attemptin to pick a color based on something I see on my screen using other techniques I am usually restricted to picking a color within a specific window (for example a webpage) rather than anywhere on me screen. Second it that picking colors usually involves several keypresses and button clicks to get to the color picker, while color mixer can be opened with one key press from anywhere.

In addition to picking colors using a dropper tool across any window on any workspace, Color Mix also provides a hue staturation and lightness tool. You may also pick a color from a list of many names, or even pick colors from the operating system theme color palette you are currently running. Finally, you may inout or output colors text by typing or copying color codes in html hex format, rgb format, and decimal rgba format.

See the video below to gain an understanding of how Color Mix is works.
