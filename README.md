## What is Color Mix

Color Mix is a small cross platform desktop utility designed to aid users in picking colors. Color Mix solves several problems I experience when picking colors while using a pc to write programs or am being creative generating designs. The first problem presents iteslef when attempting to pick a color based on something I see on my screen. Other color picking implementations invariably restrict color picking within a specific window (for example a webpage) rather than anywhere on youe screen. The second problem is that other color pciking implementations usually involve several keypresses and button clicks to begin open and begin using their color picking tool, while Color Mix can be opened and used with onesingle key press from anywhere.

To aid in picking colors from any place on your screen, Color Mix presents you with a magnifying glass view to help you pick the exact pixel you want to copy. In addition to picking colors using a dropper tool across any window on any workspace, Color Mix also provides a hue staturation and lightness tool. You may also pick a color from a list of many names, or even pick colors from you operating system theme's color palette. Finally, you may input or output colors text by typing or copying color codes in html hex, rgb, and decimal rgba formats.

See the video below to gain an understanding of how Color Mix is works.
